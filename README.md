## Project Description

**Eyes** is an iOS application that helps visually impaired individuals detect obstacles at different heights and distances using Apple’s built-in depth sensors.  
Through **real-time audio feedback**, the app provides an extra layer of awareness beyond the traditional white cane, reducing the risk of collisions with overhead or elevated objects.  

The project began with the idea of **manufacturing and donating physical devices**, but to accelerate development and reach users sooner, the first step is creating an iOS app. In the future, the vision includes designing and donating dedicated devices for broader accessibility.  

## TO-DO

1. **Audio Feedback Enhancements**  
   Add reference sounds and spatial audio cues to help users understand their environment more intuitively.  

2. **AI-Powered Text Recognition**  
   Enable real-time reading of text from books, signs, product labels, and other everyday objects.  

3. **Object Recognition**  
   Train the system to identify and describe common items, such as:  
   - Furniture (chairs, tables, sofas)  
   - Household appliances (refrigerators, microwaves, washing machines)  
   - Electronic devices (phones, computers, TVs)  
   - Food items and packaging  
   - Clothing and accessories  
   - Transportation vehicles (cars, buses, bicycles)  
   - Animals and pets  
   - Plants and trees  

4. **Spatial Awareness Features**  
   Implement precise distance and direction detection to describe the relative position of objects.  

5. **Energy Optimization**  
   Add an option to automatically turn off the screen during usage to save battery.
